                At the Facebook company,
                we are constantly iterating, solving problems
                and working together to connect people all 
                over the world through our apps and technologies.

            <h3>Instagram</h3>
            <p class="con2">
                Today, we’re introducing Live Rooms,
                giving you the ability to go Live on Instagram 
                with up to three people. Previously, you could 
                go live with only one other person in a stream,
                but we’re now letting you “double up” on your 
                live broadcast.

                Our mission is to give everyone a voice and 
                show them the world.
                We believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, 
                and that the world is a better place when we listen,
                share and build community through our stories.
                Our values are based on four essential
                freedoms that define who we are.
